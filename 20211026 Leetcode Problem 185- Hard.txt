select Department.name as Department, Employee.name as Employee, Employee.salary as Salary from employee as e1
left join department
on employee.departmentid = department.id
where

from employee as e2
where e1.departmentid = e2.departmentid and e2.salary > e1.salary);


Success->

select Department.name as Department, e1.name as Employee, e1.salary as Salary from employee as e1
left join department
on e1.departmentid = department.id
where
 3 > (select count(distinct e2.salary)
from employee as e2
where e1.departmentid = e2.departmentid and e2.salary > e1.salary);



Try using sort clause-> Only got two values from Sales- no IT. 

select Department.name as Department, e1.name as Employee, e1.salary as Salary from employee as e1
left join department
on e1.departmentid = department.id
where
 3 > (select count(distinct e2.salary)
from employee as e2
where e1.departmentid = e2.departmentid
order by e2.salary);
